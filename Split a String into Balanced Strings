# Balanced strings are those that have an equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.
# Given a balanced string s, split it into some number of substrings such that:
# Each substring is balanced.
# Return the maximum number of balanced strings you can obtain.

                d['R'] += 1
            else:
                d['L'] += 1
            # if the number of R's equals the number of L's we add 1 to the count
            if d['R'] == d['L'] and d['R'] != 0:
